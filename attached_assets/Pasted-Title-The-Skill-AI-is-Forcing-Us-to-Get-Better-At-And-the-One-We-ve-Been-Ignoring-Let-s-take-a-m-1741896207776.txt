Title: The Skill AI is Forcing Us to Get Better At (And the One We’ve Been Ignoring)

Let’s take a moment to appreciate the geniuses behind large language models (LLMs). Thanks to people much smarter than me—and the creation of transformers (machines that somehow manage to be cool without turning into sports cars)—they’ve handed the average person powers that used to be locked behind years of computer science education.

Think about it: we’ve gone from direct-to-the-source 1s and 0s, to layered programming languages, to where we are now—natural language. You don’t need to know how to code or string together an algorithm. You can now access the full depth and breadth of machine intelligence by simply doing the most natural thing there is: communicating.

And yet, here’s the catch: your ability to describe what you want—to articulate your vision with clarity and precision—is now a non-negotiable skill. The better you are at it, the better your results. Whether you’re designing a campaign, building a product, or trying to generate content that doesn’t feel like it came from a robot, this skill has quickly shifted from a “nice-to-have” to an absolute must.

This is where prompt engineering comes in. The term sounds intimidating—like some hyper-technical field for AI wizards. But let me demystify it for you: prompt engineering is just the art of description. It’s learning how to ask AI for what you want in a way that gets you closer to the results you’re after. Sure, there’s some finesse involved, like figuring out which phrases work best for different tools, but it’s really just about crafting thoughtful, intentional inputs.

Still, there’s a second piece to this puzzle that’s just as important: curation.

If description is how you talk to AI, curation is how you prepare for the conversation. It’s the data, the context, the fuel you feed into the system. What you give it matters. AI can only do so much with bad or incomplete inputs.

Here’s where it gets exciting (or overwhelming): it’s not just about text anymore. We’re already at a point where you can feed AI almost any type of content—images, PDFs, videos, entire websites. And while AI isn’t perfect at understanding all of it (yet), it’s getting closer every day.

Think bigger. Images, for example, aren’t just pictures—they can be photos of whiteboard brainstorms, scanned handwritten notes, or pages from a book. A single PDF might hold the exact context the AI needs to give you better results. The key isn’t just throwing more data at it but asking yourself:

What’s relevant to what I’m trying to achieve?
How can I organize this so it makes sense?
What unique data do I have that could make the outputs better?
And this is where I make my plea: we all need to work on our communication skills. How much better would the pre-AI world already be if we’d taken the time to get this right? Fewer misunderstandings. Clearer collaboration. Maybe even fewer wars. But now, with AI here to stay, this isn’t just about being nice or thoughtful—it’s about bending reality to your will.

Because that’s what this technology gives us: the ability to shape what we see, build what we imagine, and create what we want. All through communication. Every person with access to the internet and a browser has this power, but the results you get depend entirely on how you use it.

One day, we may not even need this skill anymore. Either Skynet will have taken over (in which case, we’ll have bigger problems), or AI will evolve to the point where it reads neural brain signals and knows what we want before we can think it. But for now, as long as the majority of the world stays intact and our relationship with machines depends on words, this ability to describe and curate will be the key to getting the most out of this technology.

So, sharpen your words. Practice describing the world you want to see. Curate the data you feed these systems thoughtfully and intentionally. The tools are here. The potential is limitless. But it’s on us to show AI the way.
